gave lab 6 pdf and asked prompt 

"explain how to implement the finite state machine described in this lab 
with verilog" 

"can you explain what the objective of this lab is step by step and describe in detail 
specifically the datapath controller" 

provided with alu.sv asked prompt 
"why does this file fail model sim compilation"

Provided output from a Verilog testbench indicating multiple failed tests related to CPU operations like `SUB`, `MOV`, `ADD`, etc.

Asked the assistant to increase the number of test cases from 10 to t20.

Provided updated testbench output with ten test cases, showing some passed and some failed.

Indicated that failed tests were ongoing and requested the assistant to ask for all code files to identify the source of errors.

Shared the complete Verilog code for `lab6_top.v` and associated modules including `input_iface`, `vDFF`, and `sseg`.

Asked the assistant to walk through testing the code on the DE1-SoC board.

Provided updated testbench output showing six failures out of ten tests.

Asked the assistant to list all previous prompts in summary form without labels or titles for easy copy-pasting.
